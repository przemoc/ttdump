ttdump  --  tun/tap dump
========================

Dump packets/frames reaching given TUN/TAP interface.


Requirements
------------

- Linux
- GNU make
- C99 compiler, like gcc or clang


Building
--------

Simply run `make` from project's root directory. If you want to see
what commands are called under the hood, then run:

    $ make V=1

Building out-of-tree is supported out-of-the-box. Go to your chosen
build directory and run there:

    $ make -f path/to/pecutils/Makefile

CC, CROSS_COMPILE, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS are respected (but extended in
the case of CFLAGS with `-std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 -Wall`), be it
environment variable or command-line variable.

Mind that if you're doing cross-compilation, then explicitly defined
CC is expected to include CROSS_COMPILE part in it already.


Installation
------------

Run `make install`. If you don't like defaults, adjust PREFIX
(/usr/local by default) or BINDIR (${PREFIX}/bin by default):

    $ make install PREFIX=/usr
